# Calendar App

Contributing to open source project can be scary. This project is built so Flatiron Cohort NYC-SE-060622 can practice working and contributing to open source projects.

Let's make a calendar app! I'm totally up to suggestions on what to make, I'm hoping this is a colaborative effort so everyone can get better at using github featurs and React :)

Here are a few brainstorming ideas feel free to add your ideas and commit to the readme: 
- Create a Calendar with similar features to google calendar 
    - Toggle between days/weeks/months 
    - add events to the calendar 
- use a db.json file where changes will persis
- use React Router

## Downloading dependencies

To download dependencies, you can run:

### `npm install`

## Starting the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

In a seperate terminal window, you can run:
### `npm run server` 

This will start the develpment server using the db.json file as the database.




The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
